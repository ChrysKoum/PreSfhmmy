## 🤖 Overview

**PreΣΦΗΜΜΥ 9: Shaping the Post-pandemic SocIoTy**  
This repository contains the source code for the contest portal developed for the 9th edition of PreΣΦΗΜΜΥ. Held in parallel with the ΣΦΗΜΜΥ (Students’ Electrical and Computer Engineers Conference), PreΣΦΗΜΜΥ focuses on challenges related to cyber-physical systems—from smart cities to IoT ecosystems—using modern software development practices.

This codebase serves not only as a contest entry but also as an educational resource, demonstrating best practices in building interactive and responsive web applications.

**For information about ΣΦΗΜΜΥ and PreΣΦΗΜΜΥ:**

> **What is ΣΦΗΜΜΥ?**  
> ΣΦΗΜΜΥ (Students’ Electrical and Computer Engineers Conference) is a national three-day event where students, academics, and companies gather to present projects, share ideas, network, and learn about the latest technological advancements.

> **What is PreΣΦΗΜΜΥ?**  
> PreΣΦΗΜΜΥ is the established technological contest held as part of the ΣΦΗΜΜΥ conference. It features multiple tracks focused on challenges relevant to Electrical and Computer Engineering. The contest is divided into two phases—the preliminary round and the final, which typically takes place during the conference.
